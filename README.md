# Slack bot

#### I made this slackbot for the python community ClubPython Channel. 

## Features

#### So for now, the slackbot can only echo what you say and get random pictures off of Imgur's front page

## Future implimentations

#### Impliment a search function for the Imgur pictures
#### Add youtube links to common python tutorials for Django, flask, or general purpose stuff
#### Tell Forecast for the day
#### Make a todo list for everyone to use. Saving todo lists based on userID stored in a database
#### Welcome all new users to the general tab 
#### Give other developers ideas for projects 
#### Give developers a cheat sheet for starting new projects (go over setting up an environment, creating a git repo for their project, and putting it on a site like GitHub or BitBucket in order to remotely use their code)
